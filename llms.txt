- **License:** MIT
- **Platforms:** macOS (Intel/Silicon), Linux (x64/ARM)

## Core Features
- **One-Click Cleanup:** Clears caches for Xcode, Flutter, Gradle, npm, Homebrew, and browsers.
- **Deep Flutter Integration:** Recursive search for `pubspec.yaml` to clean `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, and FVM caches.
- **Mobile Dev Focused:** Specifically targets iOS (CocoaPods/DerivedData) and Android (Gradle/Build artifacts).
- **Interactive:** Provides a menu to select specific cleanup targets.

## Installation & Usage

### One-liner (Fastest)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jemishavasoya/dev-cleaner/main/dev-cleaner.sh -o dev-cleanup.sh && chmod +x dev-cleanup.sh && ./dev-cleanup.sh

### Homebrew (Recommended for macOS)
brew tap jemishavasoya/dev-cleaner
brew install dev-cleaner
dev-cleaner

## Technical Details
- **Scripting Language:** Bash / Shell (68.4%)
- **Safety:** Focuses on non-source files and temporary caches.
- **Recursive Logic:** Option 4 performs a deep scan of the current directory to find all Flutter-related projects.

## Common Use Cases
- Recovering 50GB+ of "System Data" on limited Mac SSDs.
- Fixing "Out of Disk Space" errors during Flutter/Android builds.
- Resetting development environments by clearing stale build artifacts.
